# 👋 Hi, I’m **Mehdi**

### 🧠 Machine Learning Engineer · Data Scientist · Ex-Biologist  

> I explore how data, models, and code can turn complexity into clarity.  
> From cell culture experiments to deep neural networks — I’ve always been driven by the same goal: understanding systems and improving them.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- 🧩 **Building smarter models** — from churn prediction to multimodal sentiment analysis.  
- 💡 **Exploring explainable AI (XAI)** and ethical ML.  
- ☁️ **Scaling workflows** with Docker, MLflow, Airflow, and PySpark.  
- 🧬 Bridging science and data — translating biological insight into machine intelligence.
